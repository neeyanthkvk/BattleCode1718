# Recursive Fibonaccis' BattleCode Submission 

The 2017-2018 submission to BattleCode from Recursive Fibonaccis, a high school team from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

## Sprint Tournament
The Strategy for the Sprint Tournament was similar to many of the strategies contested; replicate workers, build factories, and generate as many rangers as possible to wipe out the enemy team. No further optimizations were made; and no backup plan for mars and healers were made either. The bot lost due to bug errors (We were winning!). Additionally, other factors we saw were failing included rangers getting stuck, workers not building the same factory, and timing out.
